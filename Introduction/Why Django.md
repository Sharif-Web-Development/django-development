# Why Django?


## What Django Provides

### Stability
Companies like Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla have been using Django for many years. Sites built on Django have weathered traffic spikes of over **50 thousand** hits per second.

### Scalability
Django is designed to take advantage of as much hardware as you can throw at it. Django uses a “shared-nothing” architecture, which means you can add hardware at any level – database servers, caching servers or web/application servers.

### Vast Community
There are tons of services and apps that utilize the Django framework, like:
- Instagram
- Firefox
- Dropbox
- YouTube
- Spotify
