## What is Django?

> Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

## The Birth of Django

Django was created by two people named Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison back in 2003. It grew from a practical need: World Online, a newspaper web operation responsible for building intensive web applications on journalism deadlines.

## Django's Philosophy

- **Loose coupling (fundamental goal of Django’s stack)**: The various layers of the framework shouldn’t “know” about each other unless absolutely necessary.
- **Less code**: Use as little code as possible.
- **Quick development**: Make the tedious aspects of web development fast.
- **Don't repeat yourself (DRY)**: Redundancy is bad. Normalization is good.
- **Explicit is better than implicit**: Magic shouldn’t happen unless there’s a really good reason for it. (see [Python PEP20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/))
- **Consistency**: The framework should be consistent at all levels.
