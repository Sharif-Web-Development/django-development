## What is Django's ORM? 

Django comes with a powerful feature called the **Object-Relational Mapper** ORM for short. This allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of raw SQL. Thanks to the ORM, you can:

- Define your data models using Python classes    
- Query the database in a Pythonic way
- Create, read, update, and delete records without writing a single line of SQL    
- Easily switch between different databases (e.g., from SQLite to PostgreSQL)

When you define a model in Django, you're essentially describing a database table. And every time you create an instance of that model, you're creating a **row** in that table. Here's a quick example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    published = models.DateField()
```

This will eventually become a table called something like `appname_book`, with the columns `title`, `author`, and `published`. Now, instead of writing SQL to interact with that table, you can do things like this:

```python
# Create
Book.objects.create(title="1984", author="George Orwell", published="1949-06-08")

# Read
Book.objects.all()
Book.objects.filter(author="George Orwell")

# Update
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
book.title = "Animal Farm"
book.save()

# Delete
book.delete()
```

All of this happens behind the scenes through the ORM. It translates your Python code into SQL statements, communicates with the database, and gives you back the resultsâ€”all while keeping things readable and maintainable.
